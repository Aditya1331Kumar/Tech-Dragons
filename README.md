# AI-Based Smart Traffic Management & Violence Detection System

## Team Name: Tech Dragons

---

## Problem Statement
AI-based Smart Traffic Management System along with 
the capability to detect suspect and suspicious activities 
(Specially for Women Safety-1090).


Urban Areas Face Rising Traffic Congestion Due To Rapid Urbanization, Vehicular Congestion And Complex City Layouts Making Traffic Management Inefficient. Simultaneously, Public Safety Especially For Women, Remains A Major Concern As Lack Of Advanced Monitoring Leads To Delayed Law Enforcement Response, Increasing Risks Of Harassment And Criminal Activities.

## Proposed Solution
Our AI-based Smart Traffic Management and Violence Detection System aims to solve these problems by integrating real-time surveillance, AI-powered behavioral analytics, and automated traffic control. The system dynamically optimizes traffic flow, prioritizes emergency vehicles, and identifies suspicious activities to enhance urban safety and efficiency.

## Overview
The AI-Based Smart Traffic Management System, integrated with Violence Detection, is designed to optimize traffic flow while ensuring public safety, particularly for women. Leveraging AI-driven surveillance, real-time analytics, and automated traffic control, this system aims to reduce congestion, prioritize emergency vehicles, and detect suspicious activities.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Data Collection:** 
   - Real-time inputs from CCTV cameras and IoT sensors.
   - Traffic density monitoring and behavioral data collection.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Extracting vehicle types, traffic patterns, and potential safety threats.
   - AI-based pattern recognition to detect anomalies.

3. **AI Analysis:**
   - Optimizes signal phases based on real-time congestion.
   - Identifies suspicious activities and triggers necessary alerts.

4. **Outputs & Actions:**
   - Dynamic signal adjustments for efficient traffic flow.
   - Real-time emergency vehicle clearance.
   - Instant alerts with geotagged evidence sent to law enforcement.

5. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Continuous system learning and updates for improved accuracy.

## How It Works
### 1. Data Collection
- Captures real-time traffic data and surveillance footage using IoT-enabled cameras.
- Monitors vehicle density, flow, and suspicious behavior patterns.

### 2. AI Processing & Analysis
- **Traffic Signal Management:** Uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV for vehicle detection and density assessment.
- **Violence Detection:** Implements I3D models to recognize violent activities in public spaces.
- **Anomaly Detection:** LSTM models detect unusual patterns in traffic and human behavior.

### 3. Decision Making & Execution
- **Signal Optimization:** Adjusts signal timings dynamically based on real-time traffic analysis.
- **Emergency Response:** Detects emergency vehicles and prioritizes signal clearance.
- **Suspicious Activity Alerts:** Sends geotagged alerts with video evidence to law enforcement.
- **Public Safety Guidance:** Displays safety information and escape routes on digital signage.

### 4. Continuous AI Learning
- Regular model updates using new data improve accuracy and system efficiency.
